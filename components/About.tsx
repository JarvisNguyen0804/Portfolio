        I’m a backend developer passionate about building reliable, 
        scalable systems that power seamless user experiences. 
        I focus on designing clean architectures, crafting performant APIs, 
        and engineering robust solutions using .NET and C#. 
        My favorite work lives at the intersection of system design 
        and practical engineering—creating backends that are efficient, 
        maintainable, and built with a deep respect for data integrity, 
        performance, and long-term reliability.
